# ImageColorization-Vgg16_Autoencoder
Here I save my new project. It's about colorizing gray images using TransferKnowledge and Autoencoders.

The dataset is taken from : [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedownhill/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving)

Remarks:
- I used the transfer knowledge from VGG16 to fine tune an autoencoder for colorization of gray images in the LAB format
