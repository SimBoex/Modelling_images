# U-net-TeethSegmentation

1. The dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/teeth-segmentation-on-dental-x-ray-images)

I addressed the imbalanced dataset using the binary focal loss.

Obviously, I had some problems with my current computing power, I used colab pro.


I used some code and ideas from [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalSreeni) (eg. Unet Implementation)
