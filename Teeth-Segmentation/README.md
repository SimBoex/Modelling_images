# U-net-TeethSegmentation

The dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/teeth-segmentation-on-dental-x-ray-images)

I want to review some concepts for semantic segmentation.
I addressed the imbalanced dataset using the binary focal loss.

Obviously, I had some problems with my current computing power, I used colab pro for improving this aspect.

Next steps:
- [here](https://blog.cardiogr.am/4-ways-to-debug-your-deep-neural-network-e5edb14a12d7),
- i tried with different augumentation still not better results!


I used some code and ideas from [here](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalSreeni) (eg. UnetImplementation)
